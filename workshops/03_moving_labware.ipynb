    "### Moving Labware\n",
    "Now that we have covered moving liquids around on the liquid handling apparatus, we hit a bottleneck: we are limited by the labware we can place on a given deck! If only there were a way to be able to automatically move labware to and from the liquid handling deck, we could:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Replace tip racks when they run out of tips with a fresh box.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Throw used plates into the trash.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Rotate labware\n",
    "\n",
    "- Move plates to/from specific locations on the deck that may contain specialized modules, such as heater-shakers, strong magnets, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Move plates to another piece of equipment outside the deck, such as a refrigerator, plate reader, or even another liquid handling deck (2nd robot).\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually move labware, things get a bit free-form, since there isn't a singular way to do it. Some robotic platforms, such as [Hamilton Microlab STAR platform](https://www.hamiltoncompany.com/microlab-star?srsltid=AfmBOor9rRfwPDsMrefQ3RGW64R1prQ03U29WxRBeRFfOGEDS3UAVOk3) or [OpenTrons-2](https://opentrons.com/products/opentrons-flex-gripper-gen1?kw=&cpn=21988025885&utm_term=&utm_source=google&utm_medium=cpc&utm_campaign=NAMER_Pmax_Brand_Plus_Emea&hsa_cam=21776817541&hsa_grp=&hsa_mt=&hsa_src=x&hsa_ad=&hsa_acc=2303351826&hsa_net=adwords&hsa_kw=&hsa_tgt=&hsa_ver=3&gad_source=1&gad_campaignid=21981643080&gbraid=0AAAAADemOsUxn_dtGtEETQnNTZDQP95mg&gclid=Cj0KCQjw3OjGBhDYARIsADd-uX5NmfCoeBmgGsdW_Vi9PovGUjK89S0KfF5dOU00o2EUQ4l_zZeNuucaAug4EALw_wcB) have grippers that are built in or can be attached to perform **intra-deck moves**, meaning moving labware from one spot on the deck to another.\n",
    "\n",
    "For even more flexibiility, there are **robot arm** systems which can move plates among **different lab equipment**, such as moving a plate to a plate reader, PCR machine, refrigerator, or other equipment, such as the Peak Robotics [KX2-500](https://peakrobotics.com/product/kx2-500/). Sometimes, these arms may be attached to **linear rail** systems, like [this one](https://peakrobotics.com/product/linear-rail-500mm/) to even more the arm around.\n",
    "\n",
    "Even more flexible are humanoid robots such as [Figure](https://www.figure.ai/) or [Unitree](https://www.unitree.com/R1) that can perform many tasks in a lab, especially when powered with open source robotic world models like [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) and NVIDIA [Isaac GROOT](https://github.com/NVIDIA/Isaac-GR00T).\n",
    "\n",
    "For this tutorial, we will focus on **intra-deck grippers** since they are the simplest to conceptually understand. While there are some implementations of control over gripper functions in [PLR](https://docs.pylabrobot.org/user_guide/00_liquid-handling/hamilton-star/iswap-module.html#rotations), for the most part we will be implementing **custom classes to siimulate gripper function**.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are using an extenral arm, robot, or other device, you will ultimately **integrate the code to control that device** with your liquid handling code, and this notebook will give you good practice at that.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Set up an OpenTrons-2 Deck with a custom Gripper class that we implement from scratch.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Demonstrate examples of using this gripper class to move plates around and add/remoe a custom **plate lid** to each piece of labware.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Task you with several exercises at implementing your own Gripper and functionalities."
