    "PyLabRobot *(PLR)* is a universal Python hardware and operating system-agnostic software development kit for automated and autonomous laboratories. PyLabRobot enables control of liquid handling robots, plate readers, pumps, scales, heater shakers, and other equiprment by converting Python commands to their corresponding low-level firmware/IO commands. The primary piece of equipment we care about controlling is the liquid handler, which is a robot that can aspirate and dispense precise volumes of liquid in a Cartesian coordinate system, essentially the same as hand pipetting, but automated!\n",
    "\n",
    "PLR defines a several universal interface classes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **LiquidHandler:** provides generic methods for controlling liquid handlers\n",
    "\n",
    "- **PlateReader:** (and some other classes) control other equipment like a plate reader. \n",
    "\n",
    "These **interface classes** are able to translate singular (**atomic**) commands for a robot (aspirate, drop tips, dispense, move, etc.) to any number of **supported robots** via custom **backends** (or drivers). \\[See Figure 1 for a diagram of how this works\\] This setup enables the definition of a protocol in Python, subsequent translation to any number of robots, all in one Python script or notebook!\n",

    "Depending on your installation, you may get an issue where `import pylabrobot` runs, but VS Code thinks the import is missing from your provided environment. This can happen when the installation path of libraries is **disjoint**, meaning that VS Code normally will look in your **conda** environment for all the packages being used in this notebook.

Because we do not have a lab component to this class (yet), we must do our experimentation *virtually*. Fortunately, PLR has a built-in `Visualizer` class, which enables us to host a website locally that will display our active experiment as we work!\n",

    "#### Creating a GIF of a lab protocol\n",
    "\n",
    "We kinda added everything at once there, but ideally, we would like to create a visualization of any lab protocol we use, **step-by-step**. The `Visualizer` allows us to do this pretty easily and this section will cover how to do that.\n",
    "\n",
    "You may have noticed the **Start Recording** button at the top of the visualizer. When you press this button, it will record the **current state** of the visualized deck as a screenshot. Then, after any change to the deck, the recorder will capture **a new screenshot**.\n",
    "\n",
    "These frames are then stitched together to form a final **GIF** of your lab protocol, which you can download through your browser! The key challenge is that you need to press **Start Recording** BEFORE any actions are taken by your code (such as pipetting, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The order of operations to achieve this is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Setup your initial deck and visualizer\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Switch tabs to the visualizer and click **Start Recording**\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Switch back to your code and execute the script for your protocol (just by running it)\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Wait until the script has finished execution, then switch back to the visualizer and click **Stop Recording**\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Enter a name for the `.gif` file and then click **Download GIF**.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Open your `.gif` file and verify it demonstrates your protocol correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are a couple of tips for success when working with the visualizer that we will share now:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Generally, it is good practice to work first without the visualizer as much as possible. The reason is because if an error occurs while you are using the visualizer, you may have to **reset** both the **deck** and **visualizer**. Every time the visualizer is reset, it will open a **new tab**, which can become annoying after several iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It is also good to **functionalize your code** to have one function which **sets up your deck** and one which **runs the protocol**. Typically you will find most of your errors will occur in coding the protocol, so having a function to easily set up your deck again will **speed up your dvelopment**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - We will cover this more in the deck setup tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. You can visualize your protocol running in real time by doing the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Start the visualizer\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Execute your protocol and switch back to the visualizer.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. ...**however**, if you naively do this, you'll find that the entire code will run in the blink of an eye (and you won't be able to visualize anything)\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It is best practice to introduce a **delay** between every step of your protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - This can simply by done with the `time.sleep(<duration_in_seconds>)` function in python's `time` module.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - For the following deck setup code, we also include a `time.sleep(5)` function, which will sleep the script for **5 seconds** to give us time to open the visualizer and click **Start Recording** before the rest of the script runs.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    - If you need more time to click **Start Recording**, simply increase the duration of the sleep.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, let's go ahead and give it a try below! Run the code, click the visualizer link, click **Start Recording** and watch your deck be setup in real time!"

    "That's all for workshop 0! As long as you were able to successfully download both a screenshot of your final deck setup and GIF, you should be good to go. \n",
    "\n",
    "For the remainder of the workshops, we will cover more technical aspects of PLR, but in general, all of the assignments will require you to submit one or more of the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A `.gif` file of your protocol running.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A `.png` or `.jpeg` file of your initial deck setup or final deck setup.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. A write-up describing your protocol, and any extensions thereof.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. A `.ipynb`, `.py`, or `.txt` file with your final code to produce that protocol.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this assignment, you just need to submit the `.png` file and the `.gif` file. If you are still feeling unsure on how to generate any of the following, please **reach out to the teaching team**, contact info for whom can be found in the .`README.md` file on the [class GitHub](https://github.com/chory-lab/bme590-fall-2025)\n",
