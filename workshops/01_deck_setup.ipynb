    "- **A Backend** -- The backend does the heavy lifting of converting the instructions we write in Python to **machine code** tailored to each robot. Because we do not have a lab component to this class (yet), we must do our experimentation *virtually*. Fortunately, PLR has a built-in `Visualizer` class, which enables us to host a website locally that will display our active experiment as we work!\n",

    "2. **Labware** - Labware from different companies will be compatible with different liquid handlers. You need to ensure the equipment you are importing is compatible with the machine you are using. In PLR, labware is organized by manufacturer, and using an incorrect labware will often throw an error if it is physically incompatible.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Methods** - Not only will the layout of your liquid handler change, but sometimes the methods in Python to assign child resources change as well. For example, an **OpenTrons2** liquid handler has **slots** rather than **rails** in which it can assign lab equipment. Not only does the `assign` method change, but also the deck setup, as plate/tip carriers are not needed on an **OpenTrons2**.\n",
