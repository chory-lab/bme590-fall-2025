    "Usually when you start an automated protocol, you will have reservoirs of liquid somewhere on the deck. In fancier setups, this liquid can be moved to the deck from a pump system or a robotic arm carrying a reservoir from temperature control. For these exercises we will assume the liquid was placed manually by the user (such as manual preparation of reagents or usage of a kit, as is common in many experiments)\n",

    "Therefore, to begin, we will need to **set the state** of liquids in a starting set of wells or a reservoir.\n",
